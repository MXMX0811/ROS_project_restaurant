# ROS_project_restaurant
## Overview
This is a `ROS` project developed on the basis of `RoboCup@Home` `Restaurant`. The project is running on the turtlebot2 with a robotic arm and Kinect. The robot can find the customer who is waving to the robot and then drive to the customer and ask what kind of drink does the customer want. And then the robot can drive to the location fixed on the map previously and recognize which kind of drink to catch. Finally the robot can bring the drink back to the customer.
